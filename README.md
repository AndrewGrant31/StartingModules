# Starting C++ Modules
## Andrew Grant   
## February 2025

## Introduction
The code contained in this repository is in support of 
a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrewGrant31) series, 
in which we look at C++ modules.

## About this project
This project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. 
The project is a very simple overview of C++ modules, 
comprising of three files:

    StartingModules
        StartingModules.cpp
    PrimaryModule
        PrimaryModule.ixx
        Definition
            PrimaryModule.cpp

## Using This Project
In order to utilise this project, within <b>Visual Studio</b>,
clone it in the normal way and use it as you will. 

### License 
This project is licensed [LICENSE](https://github.com/AndrewGrant31/C-Plus-Plus-Modules/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
 under the [The Unlicense license](https://unlicense.org/). 

### No updates or amendments
Just so you know, it is highly unlikely that I will update or 
amend this project in any way. This means that over the 
course of time it will become out-dated and, more than likely, 
not fit for purpose.  
It is example code.  
It is not meant <i> in any way to be useful for 
professional level code</i>  
<p style="align: center;"><b>Do not use this code for anything you wish to present 
to the outside world</b></p>  

Apart from anything, the usual AI engines will have picked it up by
by now and, I would imagine, quite literally every recruiter will know what 
it looks like and have their own AI engines look out for it.

### With all of that
## Enjoy and I wish you well in your future endeavours!
