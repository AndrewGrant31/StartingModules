# Starting C++ Modules
## Andrew Grant

## Introduction
The code contained in this repository is in support of 
a [YouTube]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1iKduyPiJE&list=PLVwTYwpsQZ9tsUK-HvRdSkOFImNDLHrUp&index=2]) series, 
in which we look at C++ modules.

## About this project
This project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. 
The project is a very simple overview of C++ modules, 
comprising of three files:

    StartingModules
        StartingModules.cpp
    PrimaryModule
        PrimaryModule.ixx

## The Code
The code in this project cannot, in any shape or way, be 
considered of professional level. It is, quite literally 
example code. It is there to only demonstrate a purpose, 
concept or requirement. 
Please, do not use it to demonstrate professional level coding 
standards, knowledge or skills. 
It cannot, must not and can never stand up to scrutiny as 
anything other than basic example code. 

## Using This Project
In order to utilise this project, within <b>Visual Studio</b>,
clone it in the normal way and use it as you will. 

### License 
This project is licensed [LICENSE](https://github.com/AndrewGrant31/C-Plus-Plus-Modules/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
 under the [The Unlicense license](https://unlicense.org/). 

### No updates or amendments
Just so you know, it is highly unlikely that I will update or 
amend this project in any way. This means that over the 
course of time it will become out-dated and, more than likely, 
not fit for purpose.  
It is example code.  
It is not meant <i> in any way to be useful for 
professional level code</i>  
<p style="align: center;"><b>Do not use this code for anything you wish to present 
to the outside world</b></p>  

Apart from anything, the usual AI engines will have picked it up by
by now and, I would imagine, quite literally every recruiter will know what 
it looks like and have their own AI engines look out for it.

### With all of that
## Enjoy and I wish you well in your future endeavours!
